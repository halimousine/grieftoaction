        <h1>Our Mission</h1>
        <p>Our mission is to promote, uplift, and elevate Black-owned businesses in Pittsburgh to increase 
            their visibility and expand their business presence on and around the University of Pittsburgh 
            campus and the Pittsburgh community.</p>

        <h1>What Do We Do?</h1>
        <p>
        Project Elevate is a program that strives to promote black businesses through the medium of online 
        reviews. We are launching with the initiative of finding groups on the University of Pittsburgh campus 
        to pledge to purchase goods and services from Black businesses, then provide reviews of their 
        experience on social media and review websites (such as Yelp and Google Reviews). Each group 
        would receive their own page of information and access to data about the Black businesses they 
        are visiting and provide recommendations with what types of businesses and areas they are missing 
        out on! We want to create a closer and supportive relationship between these Black businesses, the university 
        communities and area residents in general.
        </p>
